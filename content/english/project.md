  title : "Documentation and analysis of candombe drumming"
  content : |
    The candombe tradition in general, and candombe drumming in particular, is widely recognized as one
    of the most characteristic traits of Uruguayan popular culture. For this reason, we have been working
    for several years on the documentation and analysis of various aspects of candombe drumming.
    However, despite the importance of candombe culture and drum practice, most of Uruguayan society
    associates candombe drumming primarily with the Call Parade and carnival comparsas. The referents
    of the candombe culture remain anonymous and unknown to the larger society, and the few remaining
    groups that represent the Afro-Uruguayan culture have been made invisible, undifferentiated from the
    hundreds of groups of people who in recent years have come out to play the candombe drums
    throughout Uruguay.

    Thus, a first objective of our work is the registration of groups of drummers that are referents of the
    candombe tradition, seeking to preserve and document a rich intangible and ephemeral cultural
    heritage.

    At the same time, we seek to generate a database of labeled audiovisual records that meets the
    appropriate technical requirements for computational analysis of candombe drumming, a task that our
    research team has been developing, using signal processing and machine learning techniques.
    Our team has addressed the analysis of various technical and rhythmic aspects of candombe
    drumming, such as automatic beat and downbeat tracking, rhythmic pattern classification, microtiming
    analysis, and the study of synchronization and interpersonal interaction. To do that, an intermediate
    approach between ethnomusicology and systematic or empirical musicology has been used, based on
    music theory, ethnomusicology and computational musicology, for which own tools have been
    developed, based on signal processing and machine learning.

    Since 1990 one of the leaders of the team has been making field recordings of traditional candombe
    groups from the Sur and Palermo neighborhoods. The recordings obtained at that time were used to
    analyze various aspects of candombe drumming, and the results of the research were presented at
    regional congresses.

    In 1992 he carried out a first series of “studio” sessions, with four ensembles of four drums,
    representatives of the Sur, Palermo and Cordón Norte/Tres Cruces neighborhoods. Outstanding
    drummers such as Eduardo “Malumba” Giménez, Luis Giménez, Fernando “Lobo” Núñez, Mariano
    Barroso, Wilson Martirena, Raúl “Neno” Magariños, Julio Magariños and Luis “Mocambo” Quiroz
    participated in them. Video and multichannel audio shots were taken, with domestic equipment
    available at the time.

    In 1995, and thanks to financing through a CSIC project, a session was held with three ensembles of
    four drums in a recording studio, with professional audio and video equipment. Referents from the Sur
    and Palermo (Cuareim and Ansina) neighborhoods participated, such as brothers Juan, Raúl and
    Waldemar “Cachila” Silva, José Pedro “Perico” Gularte, Eduardo “Cacho” Giménez, brothers Gustavo
    and Edinson “Oviedo”, Raúl “Neno” Magariños, Fernando “Hurón” Silva and Sergio Ortuño. Several of
    the participating drummers have since passed away, and the recordings made then are the only
    audiovisual document of their playing.

    In 2014, the two leaders of our team jointly organized a session with five prominent drummers, all
    belonging to families with a long tradition in the Ansina playing style. State-of-the-art technology
    became available, and high-quality digital audio and video recordings were realized, including stereo
    and multi-channel audio recordings, high-definition video recordings, and high-speed video.
    Since then, the team has been making numerous recordings in different circumstances, and in this
    way has compiled a collection of more than 80 recordings in which more than 60 performers have
    participated.
