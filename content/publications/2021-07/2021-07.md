abstract: "Music  is  present  in  every  known  society,  yet  varies  from  place  to  place.  What  is  universal  to  the perception of music? We measured a signature of mental representations of rhythm in 923participants from  39  participant  groups  in  15  countries  across  5  continents,  spanning  urban  societies,  indigenous populations, and online participants. Listeners reproduced random ‘‘seed’’ rhythms; their reproductions were fed back as the stimulus (as in the game of “telephone”), such that their biases (the prior) could be estimated  from  the  distribution  of  reproductions.  Every  tested  group  showed a  priorwith  peaks  at integer ratio rhythms, suggesting that discrete rhythm “categories” at small integer ratios are universal. The occurrence and relative importance of different integer ratio categories varied across groups, often reflecting  local  musical  systems.  However,  university  students  and  online  participants  in  non-Western countries tended to resemble Western participants, underrepresenting the variability otherwise evident across cultures. The results suggest the universality of discrete mental representations of music while showing their interaction with culture-specific traditions"
