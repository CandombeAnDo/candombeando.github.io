abstract: "The analysis of micro--rhythmic aspects of music has experienced an important development in recent years. Microtiming involves small--scale temporal deviations of events in the musical surface with respect to an underlying isochronous metrical grid. These deviations can take the form of tempo variations like *rubato*; in other cases they rather consist of the time--shifting of events with respect to the steady beats of a constant tempo (e.g. *notes inégales* in Baroque or ``swing'' eighth--notes in Jazz). It has been recently argued that in some cases microtiming could be better understood by considering non--isochronous beat subdivisions.

This paper presents the results of measuring and analysing the micro--rhythmical properties of the drumming patterns in Uruguayan Candombe. Candombe rhythm results from the interaction of the patterns of three drums of different size and pitch, and its metric structure---a cycle of four beats and sixteen pulses--- shares many traits with other musics of the Afro--Atlantic world. 

The analysis of several recordings by renowned players reveals the systematic and consistent use of micro--temporal deviations in the patterns of Candombe, demonstrating that microtiming is a structural component of its rhythm."
