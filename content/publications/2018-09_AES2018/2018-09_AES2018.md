description: "A system for the automatic recognition of rhythmic patterns in percussion music from audio signals based on hidden Markov models."  
abstract: "A system under development for the automatic recognition of rhythmic patterns in percussion music from audio signals is presented. Classification is carried out using hidden Markov models. Performance is very good when training and validating with synthetic audio files, but does not generalize adequately when validating with real recordings."
