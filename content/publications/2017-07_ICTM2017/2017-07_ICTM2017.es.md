description: "Análisis de las características de la línea temporal del candombe, revelando aspectos en común con líneas temporales de otras músicas de la cultura afro-atlántica, a la vez que destacando importantes rasgos distintivos."  
abstract: "The term “timeline” was first introduced by Kwabena Nketia to refer to a
short rhythmic pattern repeated cyclically in sub-Saharan music, serving
as a reference for temporal organization and also as an identifier for
each rhythm or “song”. In the last decades, terms like timeline, guideline
(or guide pattern), bell pattern or “clave” have been extensively used by
many researchers analysing and/or comparing the morphology and the use of
these patterns in the music of Africa and the diaspora.

Uruguayan Candombe drumming is deeply rooted in the Afro-Atlantic culture,
and has many characteristics in common with other musics belonging to this
tradition, among them, the structural importance of the timeline patterns
in the rhythm. The way these patterns are integrated into the Candombe
rhythm presents, however, some distinguishing features that set it apart
from other rhythms of the same tradition.

Not very well-known abroad, the Candombe tradition has a long and rich
history; in 2009 it was inscribed on the Representative List of the
Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity by UNESCO, being considered a
symbol of the identity of communities of African descent in Montevideo.
The purpose of this paper is to analyse the characteristics of the
Candombe timeline patterns, highlighting the elements in common with other
timeline or clave patterns in the Afro-Atlantic music, and also disclosing
some important differentiating traits."
