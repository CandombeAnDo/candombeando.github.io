description: "Computer-assisted multimodal analysis of tempo and dynamics changes in candombe drumming performances."  
abstract: "The leader-follower relationship among performers is an important
aspect in the studies of interpersonal entrainment in the context of musical
performance, specially when analysing the role of leadership in instances of
changing tempo and/or dynamics. This research focuses on Uruguayan Candombe, a
rich drumming tradition deeply rooted in the Afro-Atlantic culture. The purpose
of this paper is to analyse the mechanisms by which Candombe drummers may
coordinate and synchronize changes in tempo and dynamics during the
performance, specifically at the process called *“subir la llamada”*. Of special
interest is the analysis of the cues given by the drummer that leads the rest
of the group in the process. Taking one particular recording by three expert
Candombe drummers as case study, several computational tools were applied to
extract features relevant to the analysis from the audio and video signals."
