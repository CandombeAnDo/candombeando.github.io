abstract: "Expressive communication in the arts often involves deviations from
stylistic norms, which can increase the aesthetic evaluation of an artwork or
performance. The detection and appreciation of such expressive deviations may
be amplified by cultural familiarity and expertise of the observer. One form of
expressive communication in music is playing “out of time,” including
asynchrony (deviations from synchrony between different instruments) and
non-isochrony (deviations from equal spacing between subsequent note onsets or
metric units). As previous research has provided somewhat conflicting
perspectives on the degree to which deviations from synchrony and isochrony are
aesthetically relevant, we aimed to shed new light on this topic by accounting
for the effects of listeners’ cultural familiarity and expertise. We
manipulated (a)synchrony and (non-)isochrony separately in excerpts from three
groove-based musical styles (jazz, candombe, and jembe), using timings from
real perfor­ mances. We recruited musician and non-musician participants (N =
176) from three countries (UK, Uruguay, and Mali), selected to vary in their
prior experience of hearing and performing these three styles. Participants
completed both an aesthetic preference rating task and a perceptual
discrimination task for the stimuli. Our results indicate an overall preference
toward synchrony in these styles, but culturally contingent, expertise-
dependent preferences for deviations from isochrony. This suggests that
temporal processing relies on mecha­ nisms that vary in their dependence on
low-level and high-level perception, and emphasizes the role of cultural
familiarity and expertise in shaping aesthetic preferences."
