abstract: "The Interpersonal Entrainment in Music Performance Data Collection
(IEMPDC) comprises six related corpora of music research materials: Cuban Son & Salsa
(CSS), European String Quartet (ESQ), Malian Jembe (MJ), North Indian Raga (NIR),
Tunisian Stambeli (TS), and Uruguayan Candombe (UC). The core data for each corpus
comprises media files and computationally extracted event onset timing data. Annotation
of metrical structure and code used in the preparation of the collection is also shared. The
collection is unprecedented in size and level of detail and represents a significant new
resource for empirical and computational research in music. In this article we introduce the
main features of the data collection and the methods used in its preparation. Details of
technical validation procedures and notes on data visualization are available as Appendices.
We also contextualize the collection in relation to developments in Open Science and Open
Data, discussing important distinctions between the two related concepts."
