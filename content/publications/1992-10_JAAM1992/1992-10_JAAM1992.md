description: "Transcription and analysis of a solo by master repique drummer Pedro “Perico” Gularte."  
abstract: "This paper presents, for the first time, a complete transcription of a repique solo played during a *'llamada de tambores.'* The solo was performed by Pedro 'Perico' Gularte with the carnival group (*“comparsa”*) Marabunta on February 22, 1992. The transcribed fragment constitutes a complete--albeit short--section of the 'llamada,' played between the moments when the group stopped to play the timeline pattern.
The analysis of this transcription reveals typical improvisation techniques of the repique drum, including the alternation of repique phrases with cycles of the timeline pattern played on the shell of the drum, the figures used to start and close the phrases, which are always aligned with the timeline, extended use of the primary pattern of the repique, and the use of contrasting figures to create tension."
