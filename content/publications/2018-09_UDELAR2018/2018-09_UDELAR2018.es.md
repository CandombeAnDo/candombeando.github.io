abstract: "Most of the research conducted on information technologies applied to music has
been largely limited to a few mainstream styles of the so-called ‘Western’ music.
The resulting tools often do not generalize properly or cannot be easily extended
to other music traditions. So, culture–specific approaches have been recently pro-
posed as a way to build richer and more general computational models for music.
This thesis work aims at contributing to the computer–aided study of rhythm,
with the focus on percussion music and in the search of appropriate solutions
from a culture–specific perspective by considering the Afro-Uruguayan candombe
drumming as a case study. This is mainly motivated by its challenging rhythmic
characteristics, troublesome for most of the existing analysis methods. In this way,
it attempts to push ahead the boundaries of current music technologies.
The thesis offers an overview of the historical, social and cultural context in
which candombe drumming is embedded, along with a description of the rhythm.
One of the specific contributions of the thesis is the creation of annotated
datasets of candombe drumming suitable for computational rhythm analysis. Per-
formances were purposely recorded, and received annotations of metrical informa-
tion, location of onsets, and sections. A dataset of annotated recordings for beat
and downbeat tracking was publicly released, and an audio-visual dataset of per-
formances was obtained, which serves both documentary and research purposes.
Part of the dissertation focused on the discovery and analysis of rhythmic
patterns from audio recordings. A representation in the form of a map of rhythmic
patterns based on spectral features was devised. The type of analyses that can be
conducted with the proposed methods is illustrated with some experiments.
The dissertation also systematically approached (to the best of our knowledge,
for the first time) the study and characterization of the micro–rhythmical proper-
ties of candombe drumming. The findings suggest that micro–timing is a structural
component of the rhythm, producing a sort of characteristic “swing”.
The rest of the dissertation was devoted to the automatic inference and tracking
of the metric structure from audio recordings. A supervised Bayesian scheme for
rhythmic pattern tracking was proposed, of which a software implementation was
publicly released. The results give additional evidence of the generalizability of
the Bayesian approach to complex rhythms from different music traditions.
Finally, the downbeat detection task was formulated as a data compression
problem. This resulted in a novel method that proved to be effective for a large
part of the dataset and opens up some interesting threads for future research."
