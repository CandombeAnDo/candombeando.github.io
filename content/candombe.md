    With its deep African roots, candombe drumming is widely acknowledged as one of the most defining
    features of traditional Uruguayan culture. Although internationally less known than other Latin
    American kinds of music of African origin (such as Afro-Cuban or Afro-Brazilian), candombe drumming
    possesses considerable rhythmic wealth and deserves wider recognition. In acknowledgment of its
    rich history and cultural value, in 2009, it was inscribed on the Representative List of the Intangible
    Cultural Heritage of Humanity by UNESCO (UNESCO 2009).

    The most important and representative manifestation of candombe drumming is the llamada de
    tambores: a large group of drummers playing the characteristic candombe rhythm–also called ritmo de
    llamada–while marching on the street. This is a traditional practice on weekends and holidays in
    specific points of the city. A parade of several of these groups of drummers, together with dancers and
    traditional characters, all in full costume, is a very important event during the Carnival festivities.
    For generations, candombe was practiced in the neighborhoods with a more significant concentration
    of black population in Montevideo, but now it has long been adopted by the larger society and is
    practiced by thousands of people all over the country. It remains, however, a symbol of the identity of
    communities of African descent in Uruguay. The two neighborhoods with the longest tradition of
    candombe practice are Barrio Sur and Palermo, considered the cradle of the rhythm. Each has a
    distinctive and recognizable style of performing the rhythm, usually referred to by the names of the
    prominent streets in each neighborhood: Cuareim and Ansina.

    Essentially a folkloric form, its rhythm was also integrated into different ways into several genres of
    popular music, like tango, canto popular (folkloristic popular song), and most notably in all the genres
    derived from the so-called candombe beat.
    
    The instrument of Candombe is called tambor, which is simply the word for “drum” in Spanish. There
    are three different sizes with their distinctive sound: chico (small, high-pitched), repique (medium size
    and pitch), and piano (large, low-pitched). All three drums are played with the dominant hand holding a
    stick and the other hitting the drumhead bare. The stick is also used to hit the shell, to produce a
    sound called madera (“wood”). This sound is used when playing the timeline pattern, which is called,
    precisely, madera or sometimes also clave, in analogy to the Afro-Cuban clave. The ensemble of
    drummers is called cuerda de tambores, and in a traditional llamada it comprises typically between 20
    and 60 drums (sometimes more in the Carnival parade), with proportional numbers of each of the
    three drums. Smaller groups are also common in different settings, and the minimal cuerda has one of
    each of the three drums. Each of the three drums has a different function in the rhythm and specific
    patterns associated with its respective registers; the candombe rhythm results from the interaction
    between the patterns of the three drums. An additional pattern, shared by all three drums, is the
    madera pattern or clave, with functions similar to the timeline in Afro-Cuban and sub-Saharan African
    music traditions. It serves as a means of temporal organization and synchronization, and is played by
    all the drums as an introduction to and preparation for the rhythm; during the llamada it is only played
    by the repique drum in between phrases.
