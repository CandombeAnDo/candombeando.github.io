  title : "Documentation and analysis of candombe drumming"
  content : |
    This project was started with two goals in mind: first, to document candombe drumming through high-quality audio and video recordings featuring reference players; and second, to conduct a detailed analysis of the rhythmic, technical, and musical aspects of candombe drumming. Through this work, we hope to contribute to a better understanding and appreciation of candombe culture.

    The project was led by an [interdisciplinary team]({{< ref "/team" >}} "Research team"). Luis Jure, a composer with expertise in music theory, has been documenting and analyzing candombe drumming since the 1990s. Martín Rocamora, an electrical engineer, specializes in signal processing and machine learning for computational music analysis.

    We began our joint study of candombe drumming in 2013, and the research was conducted in the performance of our respective teaching positions at the [Universidad de la República, Uruguay](https://udelar.edu.uy/portal/). At different stages of the project, we received support from the [CSIC](https://www.csic.edu.uy/), the university's research agency.

    In our work, we take an intermediate approach that combines elements of ethnomusicology, systematic musicology, and empirical musicology. This approach is based on music theory, ethnomusicology, and computational musicology. In this research, new tools were developed and existing tools were optimized to extract meaningful musical information directly from audio and, in some cases, video recordings. We used traditional digital signal processing and music information retrieval techniques, as well as innovative machine learning techniques, for automatic analysis and data extraction and visualization in computer-aided analysis.

    The results of our research have been presented at several international conferences, such as AAWM, AES–LAC, CICTeM, CIM, FMA, ICTM, ISMIR, RPPW, SMT, and SoMoS. Our [list of publications]({{< ref "/publications" >}} "List of publications") now includes journal articles, book chapters, and conference papers that focus on the analysis of technical and rhythmic aspects of candombe drumming. These publications cover topics such as automatic beat and downbeat tracking, rhythmic pattern analysis and classification, microtiming analysis, improvisation techniques, and the study of synchronization and interpersonal interaction.

    We have also [collaborated]({{< ref "team#collaborators-and-co-authors" >}} "List of collaborators and co-authors") with researchers from different countries who are working on related topics, and we have participated in several [international projects]({{< ref "/projects" >}} "List of projects").

    The creation of [audio and video recordings]({{< ref "/recordings" >}} "List of recordings") of candombe performances is another crucial aspect of this project, as the quality and quantity of data is critical to the type of analysis that will be conducted. In addition, these recordings have an inherent importance in documenting and preserving a culturally valuable tradition.

    Between 2014 and 2022, we organized several recording sessions to document groups of tambor players representing the different neighborhood styles. The groups range in size from three to nine drummers, with over 50 players from different generations. The collection currently has over 40 complete performances, totaling over four hours of audio. Each performance is captured in both multitrack (one drum per track) and stereo audio, as well as video. Detailed information such as session date, location, performers, and equipment used is available for each recording, along with annotations of the metrical structure and timing onsets for each track. Some parts of the collection have been released as [datasets]({{< ref "/collections" >}} "Datasets") for research purposes.
